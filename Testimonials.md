> I'm an rr developer, but my real job involves a lot of Gecko debugging. I find rr a great improvement over bare gdb and use it for almost all my Linux debugging tasks. It's an amazing tool!

> rr has taken the application I work on from borderline-impossible to use inside a debugger to comically easy. I've got all my coworkers hooked on it. If you're using gdb, you should probably be using rr.

> I was ecstatic when gdb gained reverse debugging abilities, but quickly had to realize it didn't work for me in practice because I was trying to debug something too big for it (Firefox). I've recently used rr to do some debugging on Firefox, and it didn't fail to deliver.
> While things like reverse-continue were relatively slow, having to wait for those was totally worth it if you look at the pain you'd have had to go through if you hadn't been able to reverse-continue in the first place.
> My only complaint about rr is that it didn't exist earlier!

> The idea of record-and-replay is not new; where rr is different is that it’s very low overhead and capable of handling complex programs like QEMU and Mozilla. It’s a usable production quality debug tool, not just a research project. I can’t recommend rr highly enough — I think it deserves to become a standard part of the Linux C/C++ developer’s toolkit, as valgrind has done before it.

> Even though we started using rr very recently, it has already cut down what would have been weeks of painful debugging for a couple of really nasty bugs.  Simply put, rr with reverse debugging is mindblowing.  We are excited to use it more and more in the future!
