rr uses [https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/rr travis-ci] for automated builds and tests.  The lifetime of a build/test run is as follows
# A committer pushes commit ''X'' to mozilla/rr
# ''X'' triggers a github service hook that notifies travis-ci
# The travis-ci infrastructure schedules a build/test task for ''X''.  The pending job shows up [https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/rr/builds here].  The output shows up "live" once the task commences, so you can watch the results come in if you're extremely bored.
# When the task completes, the results are posted [https://travis-ci.org/mozilla/rr here]

Commits that break the build or tests will notify '''''TBD'''''.
