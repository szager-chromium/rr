This page describes the implementation plan for adding the capability to create a semantic copy of an entire tracee tree (including copying files etc. as necessary), an operation we're calling "superfork".  This operation is the mechanism needed to create checkpoints of the tracee tree during replay.  Replay checkpoints are in turn needed to optimize the gdb `restart` workflow, and allow running arbitrary code in tracee processes.
