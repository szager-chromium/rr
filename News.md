**February 3, 2016**: [rr 4.1.0 released](https://github.com/mozilla/rr/releases/tag/4.1.0). The main feature of this release is major replay performance improvements: replaying buffered syscalls avoids trapping to rr. Replay is generally faster than recording now; before, it was generally slower. This release also implements support for gdb's `find` command. Various bugs have been fixed. Intel Skylake is supported. A kernel bug that caused machines to lock up during rr tests has been worked around.

**June 6, 2015**: A user-visible behavior change [documented here](http://robert.ocallahan.org/2015/06/small-change-to-rr-behavior.html) makes rr send fake SIGKILL events to gdb just before the debuggee process exits, giving users a chance to reverse-execute from that point.
