Coding styles are like, uh, noses.  Everyone has one and they all smell.  They're not dogmas but instead like war treaties: ways for people to stop fighting and get to work.  The goal of defining this coding style is to enable devs to be more productive by not having to worry about code formatting (much).

When writing code, aim for (1) clarity; (2) brevity, except where it conflicts with (1).

We use `clang-format` with https://github.com/mozilla/rr/blob/master/.clang-format to manage simple coding style issues. Run
````
find src include -name '*.cc' -or -name '*.h' -or -name '*.c'|xargs clang-format -i -style=file
````
and accept its results. If you don't, someone else will in a later commit.

Headers whose principal purpose is to introduce a type are named after the type --- `Type.h`. Other headers are named like `my_thing.h`. Implementations are named similarly, `Type.cc` or `my_thing.cc`.

rr uses 2-character indent with only spaces, no tabs.

```C++
/* -*- Mode: C++; tab-width: 8; c-basic-offset: 2 indent-tabs-mode: nil; -*- */

/**
 * "API" comments look like this.
 */
static void local_bare_function(Type* t) {
	// "Inline" comments look like this.
	// Note that "*" snuggles to type, |Type*|.  Not |Type *t|.
}
````
Use a `class` when all/most members are private and/or when a strict object lifetime cycle needs to enforced by careful use of copy/assignment. Use a `struct` when all/most members are public and objects can be copied willy-nilly.
